the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software 
Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later

Linking Proas statically or dynamically with other modules is making a 
combined work based on Proas. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU 
General Public License cover the whole combination.

In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holders of Proas give you 
permission to combine Proas program with free software programs or libraries 
that are released under the GNU LGPL and with code included in the standard 
release of Pgplot under the Pgplot license (or modified versions of such code, 
with unchanged license). You may copy and distribute such a system following 
the terms of the GNU GPL for Proas and the licenses of the other code 
concerned, provided that you include the source code of that other code when 
and as the GNU GPL requires distribution of source code.

Note that people who make modified versions of Proas are not obligated to 
grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is their choice 
whether to do so. The GNU General Public License gives permission to release a 
modified version without this exception; this exception also makes it possible 
to release a modified version which carries forward this exception.
